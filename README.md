# Jungle-Escape-Twine
This project was created using Twine. It is a text-based game in which the user has to escape a jungle, and there are multiple endings based on the user's choices. This was a team project that consisted of me and Alex Murrillo. There is an inventory system made with HTML in which the player can collect items.
